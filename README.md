# Lung-Cancer-Prediction-Using-CNN-and-Transfer-Learning

INTRODUCTION ---

Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide and its mortality rate is 19.4%. Early detection of lung tumor is done by using many imaging techniques such as Computed Tomography (CT), Sputum Cytology, Chest X-ray and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Detection means classifying tumor two classes (i)non-cancerous tumor (benign) and (ii)cancerous tumor (malignant). 

Neural network plays a key role in the recognition of the cancer cells among the normal tissues, which in turn provides an effective tool for building an assistive AI based cancer detection. Accurate classification and early detection are essential for effective treatment and improving patient survival. 

The aim of the project is to develop an efficient and accurate model for predicting lung cancer from medical images, specifically CT scans, using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and transfer learning.  

Lung cancer is a critical health challenge, and early detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have proven to excel in image analysis tasks, and Transfer Learning allows for leveraging existing models to enhance performance and efficiency. The use of chest X-ray or CT scan images is standard for lung cancer diagnosis. The combination of CNN and Transfer Learning represents a modern, effective approach to developing advanced diagnostic tools for cancer detection. 

 The model classifies lung cancer images into four categories:  Normal, Adenocarcinoma Large Cell Carcinoma and Squamous Cell Carcinoma. This project utilizes deep learning methods to create a reliable model for classifying lung cancer using chest X-ray images. By using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning, the project's approach can achieve higher accuracy in classifying lung cancer images compared to traditional methods.
